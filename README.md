# Apple App Store Data Analysis

## Introduction 
This project analyzes Apple App Store data to provide insights for an aspiring app developer. 
The objective is to help the developer make data-driven decisions about the type of app to build.
Used **Microsoft SQL Server** to perform data analysis.

## Stakeholder Questions Answered
1. **What app categories are most popular?**
2. **What price should they set?**
3. **How can they maximize user ratings?**

## Dataset 
The dataset contains two Excel files 
1. **AppleStore.xlsx** - This file contains information about the apps like name of the app, the developing organization, user ratings, number of ratings, the size in bytes, price, genre and more
2. **appleStore_description.xlsb** - This file contains the description of the app along with the size in bytes.
The dataset was downloaded from **Kaggle**. Link for the dataset here [Mobile App Store](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps).

## Key Insights and Recommendations
### 1. Paid vs Free Apps
* **Insight:** Paid apps generally achieve higher average ratings compared to free apps.
* **Recommendation:** Consider offering a paid version of the app or a freemium model (free basic version with premium features).
  Users tend to associate paid apps with better quality, which can lead to higher ratings. Ensure the app is of high quality to justify the cost.
### 2. Language Support
* **Insight:** Apps that support 10-30 languages tend to have better average ratings.
* **Recommendation:** Focus on including the right languages rather than just increasing the number of languages. Prioritize languages based on the
 target market to enhance accessibility and user satisfaction, which can improve ratings.
### 3. Genre Ratings
* **Insight:** Finance and Book categories have lower average ratings, indicating unmet user needs and potential market opportunities.
* **Recommendation:** Develop apps in these genres that address existing shortcomings and user needs. There is potential for high ratings and market
  penetration if the app effectively meets user requirements.
### 4. Description Length
* **Insight:** There is a positive correlation between the length of an app's description and its ratings.
* **Recommendation:** Provide a detailed, well-crafted description for the app. A clear and comprehensive description helps users understand the appâ€™s
features and benefits, leading to higher user satisfaction and better ratings.
### 5. Average Rating Benchmark
* **Insight:** The average app rating is 3.5.
* **Recommendation:** Aim for a rating higher than 3.5. To achieve this, focus on delivering a high-quality user experience, prompt customer support, and
regular updates based on user feedback.
### 6. Market Saturation in Games and Entertainment
* **Insight:** The Games and Entertainment categories have a high volume of apps, suggesting high competition but also high user demand.
* **Recommendation:** Entering these categories may be challenging due to saturation, but there is significant user demand. To succeed, differentiate the app with unique
and engaging features. Conduct thorough market research to identify gaps and innovative opportunities.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides crucial insights for aspiring app developers aiming to succeed in the competitive mobile applications market. By considering these data-driven recommendations, 
developers can make informed decisions about app development, pricing strategies, and methods to enhance user ratings. The ultimate goal is to create an app that not only attracts 
users but also retains them through high satisfaction and positive reviews.
